Setup Instructions:
* Terminal commands are inside ``.
- The Python version used is 3.10 and I tested this on Mac terminal.
1. Navigate to the folder 'justeat' in the terminal.
  `cd justeat`.
2. Install the necessary dependencies.
  `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the development server. 
  `python manage.py runserver`.
4. Open the project in browser:
   http://127.0.0.1:8000/ 

Assumptions:
- The restaurants given in the Just Eat API response
  were a list of the closest Just Eat affiliated restaurants to
  the given postcode. 
- For the sake of simpilicy, I labed the restaurants list as
  'Restaurants Near {$postcode}'.
- 'Rating - as a number' refers to the star rating. In the UI
  I added '({rating.count} reviews)' to make the UI look less empty and to add context to the star rating.
- I considered all items under 'cusines' as a cuisine tag even
  if it is a non-food category like "Deals".
- The API produces values for every valid UK postcode.


Improvements:
- I would allow filtering of results based on the cuisine tags,
  like 'Indian' or 'Deals'.
- I would allow ordering of results based on the rating or 
  distance to the given postcode.
- I would allow for the user to load more results at the end
  of the list page if they wanted to see more restaurants.
- I would implement more comprehensive testing for different
  possible postcode inputs.
- I would add more error handling for different possible errors.
